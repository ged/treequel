# Treequel Manual

This is a manual for *Treequel*, a Ruby library that is intended to make
interacting with an LDAP directory natural and easy without trying to make it
behave like a relational database. It's built on top of
[Ruby-LDAP](http://ruby-ldap.sourceforge.net/), so if you don't already have
that installed you'll need to install it (`gem install ruby-ldap`
should work for modern versions of Ruby), and you'll need to have access to an
LDAP server, of course.
