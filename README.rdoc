== Description

Treequel is an LDAP toolkit for Ruby. It is intended to allow quick, easy
access to LDAP directories in a manner consistent with LDAP's hierarchical,
free-form nature.

It's inspired by and modeled after {Sequel}[http://sequel.rubyforge.org/], a
kick-ass database library.

A special thanks to Ben Bleything, who was part of the initial brainstorm that
led to the creation of this library.

Thanks also to Ben Cooksley of the KDE project, who has been full of great 
ideas for the Model side of Treequel; it's vastly better for his
suggestions.
